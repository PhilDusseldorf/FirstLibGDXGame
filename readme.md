# Fill the bucket

This is a simple game where I tested the libGDX-framework for java. I decided to look for a java-based solution for programming small games as I try to get more into java.

You can control a bucket and collect raindrops that are counted in the upper left corner.

I learned to set up a screen, draw objects to it and implement simple player controls.

The game does not have multiple screens yet and also there are no winning or losing conditions. So it is an endless endeavour.

I created a [JAR](FirstLibGDXGame.jar) to give it a try.
